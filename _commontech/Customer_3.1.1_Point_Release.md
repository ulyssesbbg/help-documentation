### Point Release 3.1.1

**December 16, 2016**


This 3.1.1 Point Release is created primarily to fix some bugs that were affecting a few of our customers. Here are the changes that may affect your customer experience:

 * Urban Code Deploy [UCD] Heat plug-in was made current for 3.1.1
 * Customer-facing RBAC documentation has been [updated](http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/keystone/Managing_Users_and_Projects/)
 * Curated image for CentOS 6.8: only 2.1G disk space was seen in VM while the flavor had 10G disk 
 * Windows images assumed that hardware clock was set to local timezone instead of UTC
 * Created a new document to assist with using Nova Metadata service [http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/nova/Metadata_service_FAQ/]9 http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/nova/Metadata_service_FAQ/)
